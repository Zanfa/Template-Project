Template-Project
================
Base project with Maven, Android Annotations, Robolectric and JUnit.

Setup
================
1. Enable annotation processing from Preferences -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors
2. Make sure the processor path points to jars in your local Maven location (/Users/vahur/.m2 for me)
3. Change store generated sources relative to Module content root
4. Change production sources directory to gen/aa and test sources to gen/aa-test
